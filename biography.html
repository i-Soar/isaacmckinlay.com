    <p>
        I was born February 9th, 2006, in Brisbane, Australia, but grew up in the Sunshine Coast, where I quickly became interested in all things mathematical.
        <br><br> Throughout my teenage years, I found enjoyment in creative writing, instrumental music, chess, and later, debating. 
        <br><br> In secondary school, I was awarded an Academic High Distinction for every year from grade 8, and became Dux of my year level in Grade 10. Upon graduating, I achieved a Queensland ATAR of 99.30 and was awarded Academic Student of the Year at Chancellor State College in 2023. Passion for science and exceptional secondary school results led me to study dual Bachelor's Degrees in Mathematics (majoring in Pure Maths) and Science (majoring in Physics) at the University of Queensland.
        <br><br> Returning to Brisbane in October 2024 allowed me to be closer to university and find time to take my hobbies of chess and programming to new heights. I currently live in St Lucia, where I work as a tutor in both chess and mathematics.
